## Problem
The Indian agricultural sector is plagued by several challenges, including the lack of a direct market for farmers to sell their produce. Farmers often have to sell their produce to intermediaries at low prices, leading to lower profits. Consumers, on the other hand, have limited access to fresh produce at reasonable prices due to the involvement of intermediaries in the supply chain.
## Solution
* Develop an Android app that connects [farmers](https://github.com/Rohit-554/GFG-AnJu) directly with [consumers](https://github.com/Rohit-554/GFG-AnJuConsumerApp) without any intermediaries.
* Provide a platform for farmers to list their produce by uploading images, quantity, and price, and for consumers to purchase fresh produce directly from farmers.
* Use blockchain technology to ensure that all transactions are secure and transparent, with both farmers and consumers having their own wallets to carry out transactions.
* Make the app available in Hindi, making it accessible to farmers from all parts of India.
* Empower farmers by providing them with a direct market for their products, enabling them to earn a fair price for their produce.
* Benefit consumers by giving them access to fresh and high-quality products at reasonable prices.
* Eliminate intermediaries in the supply chain, reducing the cost for both farmers and consumers.
* Promote sustainable farming practices by introducing AGRI tokens that can be bought by users and businesses to support sustainable farming.
* Add features such as delivery services, regional language support, and voice command functionality to enhance the user experience.

## Future scope
* **Providing delivery for the purchased goods:** Currently, the project only facilitates the transaction between farmers and consumers. However, providing delivery services for the purchased goods can further enhance the user experience.
* **AGRI tokens for sustainable farming:** In the future, the project can introduce its own cryptocurrency, AGRI tokens, that can be bought by users and businesses to support sustainable farming practices. This will not only support farmers but also promote environmental sustainability.
* **Adding more regional languages:** Currently, the app is available in Hindi language. However, to make it accessible to more users, adding more regional languages can be a future goal. This will enable users from different regions to use the platform more comfortably.
* **Providing the feature to navigate in the app using voice commands:** In the future, the project can integrate voice command functionality to enhance the user experience. This feature will allow users to navigate through the app hands-free, providing a more seamless and convenient experience.
* Implementing a supply chain management system using blockchain to keep both the farmer and consumer informed about the real-time location of the product. This will enhance transparency in the supply chain and build trust among users.
